# src/lib/server — server-only logic

Everything here runs only in the Worker. SvelteKit's illegal-import guard
rejects any runtime import of `$lib/server/*` from browser-reachable code,
so this is the trust boundary: D1 handles, env secrets, and validation that
must not be bypassable live here.

## Files

| File | Migration | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `db.ts` | `0001_init` | Survey responses: `validateDraft` (throws `ValidationError`), `upsertResponse`, `getResponse`, `peekAllowlist` / `checkAllowlist`, and the shared `EMAIL_RE`. |
| `deadline.ts` | — | `deadlineStatus(env.DEADLINE)` → `{ deadline, display, closed }`. **Fails open**: an unset or unparsable deadline means "not closed". |
| `waitlist.ts` | `0003_waitlist` | Not-yet-invited sign-ups: `joinWaitlist`, `backfillWaitlistHandle`, `getWaitlistEntry`, `listWaitlist`, `promoteFromWaitlist`, `isValidWaitlistEmail`. |
| `registration.ts` | `0006_registrations` | Dec 4–7 registrations: `Registration` / `RegistrationRow` + `rowToRegistration`, `getRegistration`, `upsertConfirmed`, `setDeclined`, `listRegistrations`, and pure helpers `isRegistered`, `travelStatus`, `registrationCounts`, `noResponseHandles`. |
| `organizer/` | `0002`, `0004` | Organizer authorization, allowlist, late passes, reopen flag, anchors, page data — see `organizer/AGENTS.md`. |
| `email/` | `0005_broadcasts` | comail.at transport, branded template, confirmation + broadcast sends — see `email/AGENTS.md`. |

Migrations live in `/migrations/*.sql` and are applied with wrangler
(`d1 migrations apply`). The D1 migrations ledger in production must stay in
sync with what's applied — see the repo memory notes before running one.

## Rules

- **Parameterized SQL only.** `db.prepare('… WHERE did = ?1').bind(did)`.
  Never interpolate a value into a query string, including column lists built
  from user input.
- **Validate on the server even when the client already did.**
  `validateDraft` and `registration.validateRegistration` are the gates; the
  client versions are UX.
- **Fail loud on reads that gate destructive writes.** Pattern from the
  organizer load: a failed anchor read sets `anchorsUnavailable` and disables
  Clear, rather than rendering an empty list that a click could "clear".
- **Env access goes through `platform.env`.** `DB`, `KV`, `DEADLINE`,
  `REG_DEADLINE`, `ORGANIZER_DIDS`, `COMAIL_*`. Secrets are write-only
  wrangler secrets; code checks presence (`emailConfigured`) and never logs
  values.
- **Handles are normalized once** (`replace(/^@/, '').toLowerCase()`) at the
  write site; reads compare normalized strings.
- **PII stays in D1.** Nothing here should write emails, names, or
  emergency contacts to logs, KV, or exports beyond the organizer CSVs.

## Verify

`pnpm test` covers the pure parts (`registration.test.ts`, `email/*.test.ts`).
For anything touching SQL, run `pnpm dev` against the local D1 (wrangler
handles it) and exercise the route that calls it; there are no integration
tests against D1.
